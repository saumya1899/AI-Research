Abstract :
The Abalone Age Prediction project aimed to build a regression model to estimate the age of abalones using physical attributes such as weight, dimensions, and sex. The dataset underwent preprocessing and feature engineering using PyCaret, and various machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated. The CatBoost Regressor was identified as the best performing model. Feature importance analysis highlighted ShellWeight, ShuckedWeight, and WholeWeight as the most significant predictors of age. The model provides valuable insights into the biological characteristics influencing abalone age, demonstrating the applicability of machine learning to regression tasks involving biological data.
